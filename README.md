Visuals include a line chart for year-wise trends, bar charts for outlet and product sales, and pie charts for categorical breakdowns.

Future Improvements:
Add slicers for interactive filtering.
Incorporate growth rate calculations.
Enhance color schemes for accessibility.
Consider migration to Power BI or Tableau for advanced analytics.
